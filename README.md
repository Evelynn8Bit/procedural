# Game Project

#### Ev

Not really sure how this project is going to go, if ill continue; or even finish it, but I want to make a small web based game that I can play with my friends in real time and also separate.

I've been trying to think of some of the game play loops I want, and I want it to be a mix between a rogue like, and webkinz/moshi monsters where a player will have their own room, with customizations.

IDEAS -- Customization Spaces
Houses / Rooms / Guild Halls / Gardens / Workshops

COLLECTABLES -- Grindables
Cards / Equipment / Pets / customizables

Rogue Like -- Dungeons?
Fishing
Bug Catching
Resource Harvesting
Purchasing Resources
Building Equipment
Glamour\*? Have clothing overtop of armour / equipment for aesthetics
Pets
Profiles
Textures -- wallpapers -- banners -- levels
crafting -- desconstruction
